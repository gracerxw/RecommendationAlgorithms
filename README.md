# RecommendationAlgorithms
### Targeted Advertising using Recommendation Systems Algorithms 

Advertisers aim to maximise the return on investment from their advertising endeavours. By recommending products to the top potential buyers, advertisers can enhance the chances of conversions and sales within a constrained budget and in turn, improve marketing return of investments (ROI). To achieve this goal, the accuracy of 3 potential recommendation algorithms in identifying relevant buyers for a given product are assessed and compared. 

The 3 recommendation algorithms are 
1) Apriori Algorithm
2) Matrix Factorization (specially Alternating Least Squares)
3) Cosine Similarity

The [Amazon Fashion Review dataset and Amazon Sports Review dataset]([url](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/)) was utilised for experimenting. 

Each algorithm was ran on the two datasets. The respective models were also fine-tuned and optimised. Each algorithm was then accessed on its suitability and accuracy in recommending products to buyers most likely to make a purchase.
